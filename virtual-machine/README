0x00 - NOP - No operation
0x01 - OUT - Output character in A register to console
0x02 - JMP <imm8> - Jump to address
0x03 - JEZ <imm8> - Jump to address if value in A register is zero
0x04 - STA <imm8> - Store value in A register
0x05 - LDB - Load value from RAM into B register. Address in A register.
0x06 - SWP - Swap A and B registers
0x07 - ADD - Add B to A
